📊 Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

📌 Overview

This project performs Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset includes tweets labeled with sentiment categories, and the goal is to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns using machine learning.

🚀 Features

📥 Loads and Preprocesses Twitter training and validation datasets.

🔍 Text Cleaning using tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

🎨 Visualization

Sentiment distribution using bar charts 📊

Word clouds for different sentiments ☁️

🏆 Machine Learning Model

TF-IDF Vectorization for text representation 🔠

Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment prediction 🤖

Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

📂 Dataset

twitter_training.csv 📄

twitter_validation.csv 📄

Combined for better model performance 🔗

🔧 Installation

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud nltk scikit-learn

🛠 Usage

Run the script to execute the sentiment analysis pipeline:

python Task4.py
